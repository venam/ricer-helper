        "Terminal emulator": "Terminal emulators are graphical applications sitting between the user and the shell [ref needed]. As terminal emulators consist only of a text input to interact with the shell, there are only a few thing you can tweak: background, text colors, font and behavior.\n\nAs terminal emulators are graphical windows, you can change their aspect, starting by the background. Some terminals (like gnome-terminal, or konsole) include drop-down menus to customise most settings. In case of more minimalist terminals, you'll have to use another way to modify them. Common means are either by using the X resource database (xrdb), or by modifying the application at compilation time (by modifying a file commonly named \"config.h\"). In case of an \"xrdb compliant\" terminal, you will have to run `xrdb -merge /path/to/file` and relaunching the app to see your changes applied. For \"config.h style terminals\", a recompilation and restart of the app is needed. While drop-down menu like terminals are modified instantly.\n\nHere is a list of commonly used terminals\n# modified via mouse menus:\ngnome-terminal\nkonsole\nterminator\nyakuake\nxfce-terminal\n\n# modified via xrdb\nrxvt-unicode\nxterm\naterm\nmterm\n\n# modified via config.h\nevilvte\ntermite\nst\n\n# background\nTerminal backgrounds consists of the rectangular area filling the whole window, behind the text. Most of the time, the default color is white (or purple, in ONE. SPECIAL. CASE). Depending on your terminal of choice, you'll be able to modify the color, transparency or image background. That's pretty much it. Speaking of transparency, one can make a distinction between \ntrue and fake transparency. True transparency make your terminal look like a teinted glass. Move it around and you'll be able to see what's behind it. It require a composite manager [ref needed] to run in order to work. Fake transparency is more of a hack: when the window will stop moving, it will \"copy\" your wallpaper on the background, and apply the ply the teint your specified to it. So if you place it in front of a window, you not see the window behind your terminal, but the portion of your wallpaper behind it.\n\n# font\nYou can use two types of font: \"xft\" or \"bitmap\".\n    \n    .. to be continued\n    some links\n\n    Font\n    Colours\n    plugins\n\n",
        "File managers": "The role of a file manager is to make is easy to browse your file system and manipulate files.\nThis role defines how a file manager acts.\nThere are 2 different kinds of file managers non-graphicals and graphicals.\n\nexamples of non-graphical file managers:\ncore-utils\nranger\nvifm\ncommander\nmc (midnight commander)\n\nexample of graphical file managers:\nthunar\nnautilus\ndolphin\ncaja\ngnome-commander\n\nSome file managers follow the GTK theme (icons and colors), if graphical, some doesn't. \nThe colors of the non-graphical ones can usually be riced.\nIt's important to configure how the file manager displays and list files.\nFor graphical file managers there are multiple ways of listing, some with preview,\nsome with more information, etc..\nAnother feature some file managers adds is the ability to interact with files.\nTo execute scripts and macros by clicking them, to add a context menu when clicking on certain\ndir or files. Those are normally fully customizable.\nA file manager might also be able to access files over the network.\n\nA bunch files managers included in DE have the ability to manage the \"Desktop\", as in the \nicon displayed over the root window aka \"background\".\n\n",

        "DE": "\nA desktop environment is usually a big packages of multiple softwares that together give the user a working environment, in the sense that everything you'll ever need comes installed with the DE (Desktop Environment).\nThe number of softwares that are installed with a desktop environment varies greatly, some of them installs everyting from the window manager to the music player passing by the bluetooth manager.\nIn the ricing world desktop environments are rarely used because customizing them turns out into a job of uninstalling what has been installed and reconfiguring what has been configured for you.\nDE are a great choice if you don't have any time to create your own setup.\nRemember that everything that a DE is just a bunch of programs sticked together. They can still be installed outside of it.\nHere are the most common DE:\n    Cinnamon\n    Enlightenment \n    GNOME\n    KDE\n    LXDE\n    XFCE\n    MATE\nYou can find a bigger list here:\n    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_X_Window_System_desktop_environments\nMore information here:\n    https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Desktop_Environment\n",
        "GUI": "Many programs written for GNU/Linux have a GUI, or Graphical User Interface. GUIs for most programs are built around a toolkit called GTK+. GTK+ is a highly-customizable platform that allows end users to tweak every part of how a GUI appears. Commonly, end users install GTK themes from the internet that they like.\nIcons comprise mostly all the small pictures you see while interacting with a GUI. Icon packs can be found all over the internet, and contribute highly to an attractive GNU/Linux experience. Some popular icon packs are:\n    Numix/Numix Circle\n    Flattr\n    Moka \nGTK Themes are the backbone of ricing GUI applications. They are the difference between a dull, stock GUI, and a sexy one. The method for changing GTK themes varies by WM. Some WMs (like xfwm4) might even support their own themes outside of GTK. However, a reliable GTK theme changer is LXDE's \"LXAppearance\" program. Some GUIs rely on an older, more liked version of GTK known as GTK2, and some rely on the newer, less liked, GTK3, and some rely on both. Nonetheless, most theme packs come with support for both. Some popular GTK themes are:\n    Iris\n    simpliX\n    Numix \nMany, many themes can be found elsewhere on the internet, and a quick search for what you're looking for will likely bring up a myriad of nice themes to pick from.\nNext, we have the most finnicky of all riceable things: fonts. Fonts (specifically typefaces) comprise everything you read and write on your computer. For that reason, finding a font you like can be a challenge. Fonts come in two main styles: bitmap and stroke. Bitmap fonts (the nixers font style of choice) are made up of pixels that define the shape of the character. For this reason, they're light on resources and easy to render, but don't scale well and are often only found in one or two sizes. Stroke fonts, on the other hand, are made with mathematical formulas that allow them to scale to hundreds of different sizes. And within these two categories, there are hundreds of different styles. The two most common words you'll hear are sans and monospace typefaces. Sans fonts \nmouse cursor (kinda the same as with icons)\n",
        "Information system": "An information system can be a status bar, a panel, a dock, a conky, or a taskbar.\nStatus bar:\n\n* A status bar is a simple block of text information that stick to one of your\nscreen side. It's suppose to show information about some things in time.\n\n* A panel is similar is similar to a taskbar in the way that it sticks to a side \nof the screen however it has more things to it. It adds the possibility to \nmanipulate windows (maximize, minimize, etc..). It has widgets which are clickable.\n\n* A dock is a program that regroups some widgets (like a panel) to make it easier\nto open up programs. It might have a feature to manipulate windows.\n\n* A taskbar is the full-fledge bar. It has all the features of a panel pluts, \nit has a menu, it manages programs that runs hidden in the background (not \ndaemons but programs that have a hide feature), it manages popup messages from \nprograms (if you want to know more about popups check the nofication system part).\n\nIn the ricing world the customization can be done like so:\n    Use a custom set of icons\n    Change the colors\n    Choose what informations are displayed and write scripts for them\n    Choose the Geometry (size, position, side of the screen)\n    Change the fonts\n    Customized the popups\n\nTODO: add links to customizations + examples of the different types\n\n",
        "Wallpaper": "The wallpaper, aka background, is one of the hardest thing to choose in a setup.\nThe colors must fit with the rest of the theme, it should be coherent.\nRemember that most of the time the wallpaper will have windows on it that will hide some parts of it.\nThe wallpaper should not interfere with your workflow.\nThe safest way is to use a non colorful tile or a blurred background.\nIf you don't go for that you need to take extra care and time into choose the perfect wallpaper.\nGreat ressources for wallpapers:\nhttp://wallbase.cc\nhttp://simpledesktops.com\nSome programs can be used to simply setting the wallpaper instead of hardcoding it into the .xinitrc file.\n    bgs\n    esetroot\n    Feh\n    habak\n    hsetroot\n    Nitrogen\n    pybgsetter\n    wallpaperd\n    xli\n\n",
        "Window manager": "A window manager (WM) is a program which has the purpose of managing windows in the graphical environement. Managing windows can range from decorating them to moving them around the screen. The two main types of window managers are tiling WMs and floating (also known as stacking) WMs. For tiling WMs, the windows in a workspace are arranged by the WM and not the user. Tiling WMs can be either manual or automatic. For manual, the window layout is set by the user, and for automatic, the layout is pre-defined by the WM.\nSome popular tiling WMs:\n    herbstluftwm (manual)\n    Awesome WM (automatic)\n    i3 (automatic)\n    bspwm (manual)\n    stumpwm (manual)\nFloating WMs allow for windows to be moved around freely and stack on top of each other . This way of managing windows is the most used in other proprietary OS like MS Windows and OSX. \nHere are some popular floating WMs:\n    openbox (and all *box WMs) (star bucks lol)\n    xfwm4\n    evilwm\n    2bwm\n    cwm    \n\nOther things that might differ across Wms are:\nThe way it is Configured. Some WMs provide GUI clients for configurations (all WMs included inside DEs, openbox), text files (i3, awesome, bspwm), scripts (awesome). \nThe Border/window decoration(s). Borders can often be customized for different colors, widths, and shapes by the user. The window decorations are a feature that most often allow for quick identification and control of a window. A title bar and icons to allow minimization, maximization, and closing the window are the most common window decorations.\nThe way it handles Keybindings. Some Wms are keyboard driven, meaning that they are designed for quick control. Some other don't even handle keys and let a third party program do the job (for example bspwm).\nThe way it manages workspaces.There are many types of workspace, tags, desktops... (here need to explain it a bit for the dumb user)\nA website with a long list of Wms: http://xwinman.org \nAlong with the window manger some other programs can be used along to add fancy decoration to the windows. Often a compositor manager is used. A composite manager is a program that is used to render extra shadows, blurring, and transparency to the windows. Here is a list of well known composite\n    Xcompmgr \n    Compiz \n    Compton\n    Cairo Composite Manager\n\n"

Spending a lot of time in the TTY can be harsh if it hasn't been customized, it's like fighting a beast.\nThe TTY only accepts some specific types of fonts. On GNU/Linux they can be found in /usr/share/kbd/console/fonts. You can show the current font using the `showconsolefont` command and change the font using the `setfont` command.\nThe default TTY colors are white on black. To change them you'll have to use perl-term-extendedcolor-tty (ttycolor) or just use `echo` with some special escape characters for colors(set them in your shell).\nTo make it easy to multitask in the TTY you'll have to use a terminal multiplexer, a program that lets you use multiple terminals (emulator) in the same TTY and (but not inclusive) detach programs from one terminal to another. Tmux or dtach+dvtm can do this.\nThe framebuffer can be used to watch videos and view images in the TTY.
